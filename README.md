# Optical Character Recognition
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) midterm project for COMS 4995: Applied Computer Vision at Columbia University. This project aims to test the extent of an OCR pipeline when the main recognition network is trained on visually simple (binary) images. 


OCR.py with parameters will train the residual neural network for character classification, pipeline.py will run the end-to-end system that takes multi-char images and eventually gives a series of labels of the individual characters present.
